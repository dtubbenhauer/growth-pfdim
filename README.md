# Code and Erratum for *Asymptotics in finite monoidal categories*

I collected a bit of Magma and Mathematica code relevant for the paper *Asymptotics in finite monoidal categories*
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03044">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03044</a> on this page.

The code is in a **text** file or **.n** file, respectively, that can be downloaded from this site and you can run it with Mathematica.

An Erratum for the paper *Asymptotics in finite monoidal categories* can be found at the bottom of the page.

# Background

# The Magma code

# The Mathematica code

The code is hopefully pretty straightforward. All that is happening is that 
the data created with the Magma code is plotted.

For example, here is the dihedral group of order ten:

Let me know if there are nay questions!

# Erratum

Empty so far.
